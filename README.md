# nginx-micro

> **Ultra-minimal, statically-linked, multi-architecture NGINX Docker image.**

A blazing-fast, container-native NGINX image‚Äîjust **hundreds of kilobytes**‚Äîwith no shell, no package manager, and no attack surface beyond static serving and FastCGI.
**Purpose-built** for modern container stacks, edge deployments, and anyone who wants a rock-solid, tiny HTTP server.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Why nginx-micro?

* **FROM scratch**: No shell, no package manager, no interpreter. Zero bloat.
* **Attack surface**: *Minimized.* Only HTTP and FastCGI (for PHP) are supported.
* **Security**: GPG-verified source, no extraneous libraries.
* **Multi-arch**: Works on virtually any Linux system, cloud, Pi, or even mainframe.
* **Logs to stdout/stderr**: Perfect for Docker/Kubernetes observability.
* **Plug-and-play config**: Use the included config, or mount your own.
* **Built for insecure HTTP**: Use behind any SSL-terminating reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy, nginx, Cloudflare, etc.).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Intended Use

* **NOT for direct SSL/public internet use!**
* *Deploy behind an SSL reverse proxy or load balancer.*
* *Ideal for:*

  * Static sites
  * PHP apps (WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, etc. via FastCGI)
  * Health checks
  * Serving assets in microservices
  * Demo/staging/CI

---

## üèÅ Quick Start

### **Serve static files from your current directory:**

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd):/www \
  tigersmile/nginx-micro
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

---

### **Mount your own `nginx.conf` for full control:**

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/conf/nginx.conf:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/site:/www \
  tigersmile/nginx-micro
```

---

### **Use with PHP-FPM (e.g., WordPress/Drupal):**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  nginx:
    image: tigersmile/nginx-micro
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/conf
      - ./www:/www
    depends_on:
      - php-fpm
    networks: [ web ]
  php-fpm:
    image: php:fpm
    volumes:
      - ./www:/www
    networks: [ web ]
networks:
  web:
```

---

## üìù Default nginx.conf

```nginx
user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;
error_log  /dev/stdout warn;
pid        /nginx.pid;

events { worker_connections  1024; }

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    access_log    /dev/stdout;

    sendfile      on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  _;

        root   /www;
        index  index.html index.php;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        # For PHP-FPM
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
            fastcgi_pass   php-fpm:9000;
            fastcgi_index  index.php;
            include        fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

## üîí Security Notes

* **Runs as root** (needed for port 80 in containers), but worker processes run as `nginx` user by default.
* No shell or package manager‚Äîcan‚Äôt be ‚Äúcontainer escaped‚Äù by shell exploits.
* No writable filesystem, no interpreters.
* To run as non-root:

  1. Change `listen` to a high port (e.g., 8080) in your config.
  2. Start with `--user nginx` or add `USER nginx` to your own Dockerfile.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Building Yourself

Requires Docker with Buildx and QEMU (for multi-arch):

```sh
docker buildx bake
```

*(Uses included `docker-bake.hcl` for all architectures.)*
